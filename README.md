# Vision Transformer

A comprehensive implementation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification tasks, featuring a complete implementation applied to the MNIST dataset.

## Description

Vision Transformers represent a revolutionary approach to computer vision that adapts the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to image classification tasks. This repository contains a practical implementation that demonstrates how to apply ViTs to handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that process images through local convolutions, Vision Transformers split images into patches and treat them as sequences, applying self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across the entire image.

## Key Features

- **Pure Transformer Architecture**: Implementation of ViT without convolutional layers
- **Patch Embedding**: Converting image patches into token embeddings
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Capturing global relationships between image patches
- **Position Encoding**: Maintaining spatial information of image patches
- **Classification Head**: Linear layer for final prediction
- **MNIST Application**: Practical demonstration on handwritten digit classification

## Contents

- `ViT_Vision_Transformer.ipynb` - Complete Jupyter notebook implementation including:
  - Vision Transformer model architecture
  - Data preprocessing and patch extraction
  - Training and evaluation pipeline
  - Visualization of attention maps
  - Performance metrics and analysis

## Architecture Overview

The Vision Transformer architecture consists of:

1. **Patch Extraction**: Images are divided into fixed-size patches (e.g., 16x16 pixels)
2. **Linear Embedding**: Each patch is flattened and linearly embedded to create patch embeddings
3. **Position Encoding**: Learnable position embeddings are added to preserve spatial information
4. **Transformer Encoder**: Multiple layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks
5. **Classification Head**: MLP head for final class prediction

## Requirements

```
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nakshatra1729yuvi/Vision-Transformer.git
cd Vision-Transformer
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn
# OR for PyTorch:
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `ViT_Vision_Transformer.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `ViT_Vision_Transformer.ipynb`
2. Execute cells in order to:
   - Load and preprocess MNIST dataset
   - Define the Vision Transformer architecture
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate performance
   - Visualize attention maps

### Key Components

**Patch Embedding**
```python
# Convert image to patches
patches = extract_patches(image, patch_size=16)
embeddings = linear_projection(patches)
```

**Multi-Head Self-Attention**
```python
# Apply self-attention to patch sequences
attention_output = multi_head_attention(patch_embeddings)
```

**Position Encoding**
```python
# Add positional information
positioned_embeddings = patch_embeddings + position_embeddings
```

## Model Performance

The Vision Transformer implementation achieves competitive results on MNIST:
- High accuracy on digit classification
- Interpretable attention patterns
- Efficient training convergence

## Vision Transformer Concepts

### Self-Attention in Vision
Unlike CNNs that process local neighborhoods, ViTs can attend to any part of the image, enabling global context understanding from the first layer.

### Patch-Based Processing
Images are treated as sequences of patches, similar to how text is processed as sequences of words in NLP transformers.

### Scalability
Vision Transformers scale well with data and model size, often outperforming CNNs on large datasets.
